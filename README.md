# BladeBuilder
BladeBuilder is a modern tool for calculating knives and separators used for cutting circular shapes out of sheet metal, which allows users 
to make easy and precise calculations based on given dimensions of the sheet metal, its thickness, and the knives used for cutting. With this tool,
users can quickly determine the centers of separators and knives, calculate necessary dimensions along with spacing, and have the results attributed
to them through a unique pin and name. Users can immediately view their calculation results on the website or print them, greatly facilitating 
the machine retooling process.

BladeBuilder also allows for the addition and management of new users, as well as a calculation history that displays all the calculations made
and enables searching for them by date. Additionally, the application has been expanded with the ability to add orders, which allows for quick formatting
of a printable table and displaying detailed information for each order. BladeBuilder makes it easy to manage calculations and orders, resulting 
in time savings and improved work efficiency.

Please note that the BladeBuilder project is still ongoing and I am continuously working on it. I believe that through further development and refinement of this tool, I will be able to introduce even more functionality and improvements to meet users' expectations. My commitment to this project is unwavering, and my goal is to deliver a complete, intuitive, and versatile tool that greatly facilitates the calculation process, order management, and enhances work efficiency.
